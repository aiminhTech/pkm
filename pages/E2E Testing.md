- ## End-to-End Testing
	- **End-to-end (E2E) testing** is a type of software testing that verifies the complete flow of an application from start to finish, ensuring that all components and systems work together as expected. It simulates real user scenarios to validate that the application behaves correctly in a production-like environment.

		- **"End-to-end"** refers to testing the entire application, from the **user interface (frontend)** through the **backend**, and possibly **external services**, **databases**, and **networks**.
		- The goal is to mimic real-world usage and ensure all parts of the system are integrated properly.
