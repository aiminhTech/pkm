- Brute force is a method of solving problems or cracking codes through trial and error, systematically trying all possible combinations until the correct one is found.
- Brute force is simple but inefficient, as it often requires a lot of computational power and time, especially for problems with large possibilities. Itâ€™s generally not the most optimal approach but can work if the problem space is small enough or if no other method is available.
- ## Password Cracking
	- Trying every possible combination of characters (letters, numbers, symbols) to break into an account.
- ## Algorithmic Problems
	- Trying all possible solutions or paths in a computational problem (like a maze or optimization problem) until the best one is found.
- ## Cryptography
	- Attempting to decode encrypted messages by trying every possible key until the correct one is found.
