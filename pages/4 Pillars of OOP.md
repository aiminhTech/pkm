- ## Encapsulation
  collapsed:: true
	- Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit
	- **Purpose**:
		- helps in data hiding, abstraction, and providing a clear interface for interacting with objects.
		- allows for better control over the access and modification of object state.
- ## Inheritance
	- When an onject (child or derived) acquires the props & behaviours of the parent object
	- **Purpose**:
		- promotes code reusability, extensibility, and the creation of class hierarchies where more specialized classes inherit attributes and methods from more general classes.
- ## Polymorphism
  collapsed:: true
	- When one task is performed several diffrent ways
	- **Purpose:**
		- romotes flexibility and extensibility in code.
		- allows you to write code that can work with objects of multiple classes as long as they share a common interface or superclass.
- ## Abstraction
  collapsed:: true
	- Modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors relevant to the problem domain while ignoring unnecessary details.
	- **Purpose**:
		- helps manage complexity by focusing on the most relevant aspects of an object or system
