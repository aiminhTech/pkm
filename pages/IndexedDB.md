- Short for **Indexed Database**
- A low-level API for client-side storage of significant amounts of structured data, including files/blobs.
- It is a part of the web platform's API (Application Programming Interface) and allows web applications to store data on the client-side, providing a more efficient and flexible way to work with data compared to older web storage mechanisms like cookies or Web Storage ([[localStorage]] and [[sessionStorage]]).
- **NoSQL Database**:
	- IndexedDB is a NoSQL database system, meaning it stores data in a structured, object-oriented way using JavaScript objects **(key-value pairs)**, and it doesn't rely on fixed table schemas.
- **Indexed Storage**:
	- Data stored in IndexedDB can be indexed, which allows for efficient querying and retrieval of specific data.
	- You can create indexes on fields in the stored objects, making it easier to search and filter data.
