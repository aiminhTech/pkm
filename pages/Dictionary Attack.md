tags:: [[Brute Force]]

- A type of brute force attack used to crack passwords or encryption keys by systematically entering every word in a pre-arranged list (the "dictionary").
- This list typically contains common words, phrases, or simple variations of them (like adding numbers or symbols), based on the assumption that many users use simple or common passwords.
- To protect against dictionary attacks, it's recommended to use strong, complex passwords with a mix of letters (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and special characters. Additionally, enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) provides an extra layer of security.
- ## How it works
	- **Dictionary List**: A hacker creates or uses a pre-built dictionary (a text file or list) filled with words commonly used as passwords, such as "password," "123456," or "qwerty," along with variations (like "password123" or "admin2025").
	- **Password Guessing**: The attacker uses software to automatically try each word from the dictionary as the password, typically in a very fast manner.
	- **Success or Failure**: If the password matches any word in the dictionary, the attacker successfully gains access. If not, the attacker may move on to try other methods, such as brute force or more sophisticated password-cracking techniques.
- ## Advantages
	- Faster than pure brute force, since the dictionary consists of commonly used words and phrases that are more likely to be someone's password
- ## Limitations
	- Itâ€™s less effective if the target uses a unique or complex password that isn't based on common words or phrases.
