- ## OAuth 2.0
	- https://oauth.net/2/
	- Third-party authentication
	- Users authenticate via an external provider like Goole, GitHub or Facebook. The application receives a token from the provider that confirms the user's identity.
	- **Pros:**
		- Users don’t need to create a new password for your service
		- Offloads authentication to trusted providers
	- **Cons**
		- Relies on third-party
		- Requires integration with external services
-
- ## Stateless Token Auth
	- https://www.jwt.io/introduction#what-is-json-web-token
	- Token-based authentication
	- The server issues a **JWT (JSON Web Token)** after user login. The token contains all necessary user information and is stored **client-side** (usually in local storage or cookies). On each request, the token is sent to the server and validated.
	- **Pros:**
		- No server-side session storage required
		- Scales easily across multiple servers
	- **Cons:**
		- Token revocation is hard (can’t immediately invalidate a JWT)
		- Tokens may be vulnerable if not stored securely on the client
-
- ##  Stateful Token Authentication
	- Token-based authentication with server-side storage
	- The server generates an **authentication token** and stores it in a **server-side session store** (e.g., in memory or database). The client sends this token with each request, and the server validates it against its stored session.
	- **Pros:**
		- Easy to revoke sessions (e.g., logout)
		- Centralized control of active sessions
	- **Cons:**
		- Server must store session data, which can impact scalability
		- Needs session management for multiple servers (requires shared storage)
		-
- ## Summarize
	- **OAuth 2.0** = delegate login to external providers.
	- **Stateless JWT** = store token on client, server doesn’t track sessions.
	- **Stateful token** = store token on server, server tracks sessions.
