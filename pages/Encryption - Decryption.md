-
- ## Encryption
	- Protects data so only authorized people can read it.
	- Converts **plaintext** (readable data) into **ciphertext** (unreadable data) using an **encryption key**.
	- **Example:** You type a message “Hello” → encryption → “Xy7$1B” (ciphertext).
	-
- ## Decryption
	- Converts the encrypted data back to its original form.
	- Uses a **decryption key** (sometimes same as encryption key) to turn ciphertext back into plaintext.
	- **Example:** “Xy7$1B” → decryption → “Hello”.
