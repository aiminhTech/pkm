	- Help find errors before program goes live (catch bugs early)
	- We can change code without fear of breaking existing functionality
	- Test show how the code is supposed to behave
	- Less time spent fixing bugs later
	- Encourages writing modular, clean code

- ## Notes
	- Writing test isn't hard. But, some code is hard to test
	- Your test don't pass because you code works. They pass because the didn't fail
	- Someone is always testing your code
	- No one has ever broken their code into many, small, well-named, easy-to-tests functions
