- # What is an ISO 8601 duration?
	- ISO 8601 is a set of standardized date and time formats in an attempt to tame every programmer's favorite challenge
	- Durations represent the amount of time between two dates or times.
	- This format displays a duration in the following format: `PnYnMnDTnHnMnS` where `n` is the number for the corresponding interval:
		- Y = years
		- M = months
		- W = weeks
		- D = days
		- T = delineator between dates and times, necessary to disambiguate between months and minutes
		- H = hours
		- M = minutes
		- S = seconds
	- You can leave certain intervals off  if they don't apply, but you must include the `T` before any time intervals (`P<date>T<time>`). Valid examples include:
		- `P3Y6M4DT12H30M5S` (3 years, 6 months, 4 days, 12 hours, 30 minutes, and 5 seconds)
		- `P3DT12H` (3 days and 12 hours)
		- `P1M` (1 month)
		- `PT1M` (1 minute)
		- `PT0S` (0)
		- `P0.5Y` (1/2 a year)
		- `PT1M3.025S` (1 minute and 3025 milliseconds)
