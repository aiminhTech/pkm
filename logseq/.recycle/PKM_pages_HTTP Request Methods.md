- HTTP is enabled to communicate between **clients** and **servers**.  It works as a request-response protocol between a client and sever.
- Example: A client (browser) sends an HTTP request to the server; then the server returns a response to the client. The response contains status information about the request and may also contain the requested content.
- Methods
	- Both GET and POST methods are sending data to the server for processing after the user enters information into the form and submits it.
		- [[GET]]
		- [[POST]]
