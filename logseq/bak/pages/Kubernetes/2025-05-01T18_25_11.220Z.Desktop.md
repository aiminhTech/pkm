- ## [[Container Image]]
	- Created by using [[Podman]]
- ## Manifests
	- create with [[yaml]] or [[JSON]] files
	- a manifest file typically refers to a configuration file that describes the desired state of resources to be deployed on the platform.
	- ### ImageStream
		- is used to manage container images #Podman
		- tag a locally built container image exp. :
			- `podman tag localhost/time-svc:latest default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps.ipip-ocp.ipip.ch/test-qai-hello-openshift/time-svc:latest`
	- ### Pod
		- Describes a single instance of a running process in a cluster.
		- It can include details about containers, volumes, and other specifications.
	- ### Deployment (dp)
		- A resource object used to manage the deployment and scaling of a set of replica Pods.
		- Deployments provide a declarative way to define and update the desired state of an application in a Kubernetes cluster.
	- ### Route (rt)
		- a resource used to expose services outside of the cluster, making them accessible from external networks, such as the internet.
	- ### Service (svc)
		- Define **a set of pods** and a policy by which to access them.
		- Services allow other pods in the cluster to communicate with the pods that belong to the service.
		- enable **network communication between different parts** of your application, both within the cluster and from external sources.
		- They act as a stable endpoint to which other applications or services can connect, regardless of the underlying Pods' dynamic nature.
	- ### Volume Claim (pvc)
		- allows a user to request storage resources without having to know the underlying details of the storage infrastructure.
	- ### ConfigMap and Secret Manifests
		- ConfigMaps hold configuration data as key-value pairs, while Secrets  store sensitive information like passwords or API keys.
		- These can be mounted into pods as volumes.
