	- ## Deployment (dp)
		- A resource object used to manage the deployment and scaling of a set of replica Pods.
		- Deployments provide a declarative way to define and update the desired state of an application in a Kubernetes cluster.
	- ## Route (rt)
		- a resource used to expose services outside of the cluster, making them accessible from external networks, such as the internet.
	- ## Service (svc)
		- An abstraction that defines a set of Pods and a policy for accessing them.
		- Services enable network communication between different parts of your application, both within the cluster and from external sources.
		- They act as a stable endpoint to which other applications or services can connect, regardless of the underlying Pods' dynamic nature.
